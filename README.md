# Password Generator

## Description

This is a password generator made functional entirely through JavaScript! This application can generate passwords that are 8 to 128 characters long and meet anyone's choices of criteria when it comes to including lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. I was motivated to work on this challenge because everyone needs passwords for all kinds of accounts people may have. This makes creating a safe password that no one can guess easy to create! By completing this challenge, I learned just how great the role of JavaScript is when creating a webpage for any use.
